	This note presents calculated statistical correlation coefficients between the different \Rone $\omega_{a}$ analyses. The correlation coefficients were calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation taking real data as input, for which the implementation is described. The statistical correlations presented here include the effects from the different reconstructions, different analysis methods (TARQ), and different analyzer-specific analysis parameters. Depending on the combination methodology adopted, these statistical correlations may be needed in order to properly combine the results. Various versions of the statistical correlations were provided to the combination effort, and results for the combination will be detailed by a forthcoming note. These statistical correlations are the most accurate to date for \Rone, and can be used as a starting point going forward for combinations of future \wa analyses.
