\section{Conclusions}

- talk about general scale of numbers here?

- briefly highlight results, and mention what they could be used for
	- Run 1 combination tests
	- starting point for future combinations

	


-differences between this MC and data, including some reminders
 - East vs West comparison was based on Aaron's counts
 - used Matteo's energy bin functions and others might be slightly different
 - different pileup methods, though the effect should be sub leading since it's the corrected spectrum that is important
 - pileup in Josh's stuff
 - systematic differences between analyses, talk about ratio method a little bit
 - Q method differences to be expected - somewhat reflected I think in the larger errors on the Q method coefficients
 - the VW randomization that I do in my analysis, leading to slightly larger errors, and presumably slightly different coefficients because of a different width
 - different randomization methods and number of seeds between different analyzers
- all of this should in general decrease the correlations between the analyses

- talk about the clipping of correlation coefficients, cite David's collab talk
	- mention how a number of my coefficients are above this clipping threshold but not most of them
	- the amount of clipping is usually around the sub percent level or less, could easily be explained by the above differences, though I'm still not sure if all the coefficients should be below the clipping threshold


- talk about things that could be improved
	- better randomization, potential fix to imperfect R method fits, though it's unclear, and the better randomization might take a long time
	- finer time and energy points, fixes some imperfect fits in the Q method


- look over my stats corrs powerpoint to see if there is anything in there that should be included here


% - don't do pileup, the effect should be a lot smaller than the energy threshold changes between analyses after pileup subtraction, it would be a major effort to somehow put in different pileup cases, etc.
